# WireBundle

#### A Logic World mod that can bundle from 2 to 16 inputs into one line and split it.

## Info
This mod does not use a custom wire to transfer the data. The splitter only uses the wire that is connecting the components to fetch the data from the bundler.

The mod has two components, the bundler and the splitter. Use the bundler to bundle inputs and connect it **directly** to the splitter as it won't work otherwise (for now).

Connecting two components to the splitter will just use the first bundler that it finds although I am planning to make it merge multiple bundlers.
